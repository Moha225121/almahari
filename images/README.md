Place your final transparent logo file here with the exact filename `logo_final.png`.

Suggested steps:
- Add a PNG with transparency or an SVG named `logo_final.png`.
- Recommended size: height around 100px for high-DPI; CSS will scale it down to `50px`.
- If you want, upload the file here and I can optimize/convert it and add a `srcset`.

If you prefer to keep the original `logo1.png` as a backup, leave it in the project root.
